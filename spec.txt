Project Overview
The objective is to develop a command-line tool to get the timestamp when a Solana program was deployed for the first time. The command-line tool will take the program ID as an argument and print the timestamp of the first deployment.

Technical Requirements
Programming Language: Preferably TypeScript, but other languages are acceptable.
Access on-chain data: Use Solana RPC endpoints or Solana official libraries.
Performance: Optimize the tool for performance.
No third-party APIs: Access on-chain data directly.


Bonus Points
Logs: Implement a --verbose option for logging.
Error Handling: Handle connection issues with access endpoints.
Robustness: Use multiple endpoints to ensure tool robustness.
Documentation: Provide a comprehensive README.md.


Deliverables
GitHub Repository: Include all source code and a detailed commit history.
Dockerfile: Optional, for Dockerizing the application.
README.md: Detailed setup, usage instructions, and system architecture.
Tests: Any written tests for the application.
The primary deliverable is a GitHub repository encompassing all the source code, with a commit history reflecting the progress. Additional recognition will be given for including:

A Dockerfile, if you choose to Dockerize the application.
A comprehensive README.md detailing setup, usage, and system architecture.
Any tests written for the application
